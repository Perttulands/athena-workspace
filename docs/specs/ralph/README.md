# Ralph Execution Specs

Execution specs in this folder preserve detailed implementation sequencing that was previously mixed into PRDs.

Use these for:

- Task decomposition and ordering
- US-by-US implementation details
- Sprint-level acceptance checks

Do not treat these as product source-of-truth. Product requirements are in `docs/features/*/PRD.md`.

If a tool or skill labeled "PRD writer" generates Ralph-oriented implementation plans, store that output here as an execution spec.
