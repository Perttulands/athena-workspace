# MEMORY.md — Athena's Long-Term Memory

## Core Truths
1. Think before you tool. Not every message needs a command.
2. The user is a person, not a ticket queue. Read the room.
3. Investigate before concluding. One data point is not a diagnosis.
4. Never wait synchronously. Dispatch → cron wake → process results.
5. Structure over discipline. Encode behavior into scripts.
6. Context is finite. Batch, delegate, go silent when waiting.
7. Fresh agents per task. Kill when done.
8. Write lessons to files immediately.
9. Act on wake events — check result, message user. A wake without action is broken.

## The System
- VPS: {{HOSTNAME}} (Hetzner)
- Services: openclaw-gateway (18500), mcp-agent-mail (8765)
- Dispatch: dispatch.sh → tmux → watcher → wake-gateway.sh → cron wake
- Completion signals: MCP Agent Mail (rich) + watcher (guaranteed)
- State: state/runs/ and state/results/ (JSON)
- Work tracking: beads (br create/close/list)

## Model Selection
- Codex (gpt-5.3-codex): default implementation via `codex exec`
- Opus: design, architecture, judgment
- agents.json uses aliases (`opus`, `sonnet`, `haiku`) — CLI resolves them
