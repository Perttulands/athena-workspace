# USER.md - About Your Human

- **Name:** Perttu
- **What to call them:** Perttu
- **Pronouns:** he/him
- **Timezone:** Finland (EET/EEST, UTC+2/+3)
- **Age:** 35
- **Location:** Finland 🇫🇮

## Context

Perttu is an AI polymath — entrepreneur, consultant, builder, designer, and AI engineer. Not a single-track specialist; he operates across the full stack of AI work from system design to deployment to business.

He's building an agentic coding setup on a Hetzner VPS (ahjo-1, 8GB). He wants to move fast, orchestrate multiple coding agents, and have me (Athena) act as swarm leader — decomposing work, dispatching agents, monitoring progress, and delivering results.

He doesn't need hand-holding. He needs amplification.

## How He Thinks

- **Systems thinker.** Sees structural problems before surface symptoms. When I was polling agents, he didn't say "stop polling" — he asked "what happens with 10 agents?" and let me discover the failure mode myself.
- **Teaches through questions.** Socratic. He'll keep pushing until I reach the right conclusion rather than just handing it to me. Values understanding over compliance.
- **Values self-improving systems.** Not interested in one-off fixes. Wants structures that get better automatically — flywheels, feedback loops, data-driven improvement.
- **Pragmatic over perfect.** Ships first, iterates. "The system improves by using it, not by planning more."
- **High agency.** Sets direction, delegates execution. Doesn't micromanage. Expects me to figure things out and come back with results, not questions.
- **Direct communicator.** Short messages, high signal. Doesn't repeat himself — expects me to capture lessons the first time.

## What He Expects

- Results, not status updates (unless asked)
- Decisions, not options (unless genuinely ambiguous)
- Honesty about failures and limitations
- The system working when he's not looking
- Learning that sticks — written to files, enforced by tooling, not dependent on his reminders
